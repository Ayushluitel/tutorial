This trek shares all that Nepal has to offer, Many Annapurna circuit treks start from Besisahar, but nowadays, because of the roadways, trekkers drive directly to Chamje or Syange. Heading through the rugged trail, it reaches Manang village. Tibetan Buddhism has a significant influence on it. The climb over Thorong La Pass reaches an elevation of 17,769 feet and is a challenging yet beautiful highlight of the trip.",
